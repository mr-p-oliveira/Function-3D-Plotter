# Function 3D Plotter 
 Function 3D Plotter using GUIDE (MATLAB)

MATLAB is a very valuable first programming language it has evolved to include
many powerful and convenient graphical and analysis tools.

The graphical user interface development environment (GUIDE) enables the rapid creation
of a graphical user interface (GUI) for a MATLAB program.To start GUIDE just type 
`>> guide` .

You can choose to open a Blank GUI or open existing GUI.

## In short

This is a small work developed for a discipline in college to learn how to work with MATLAB and the GUIDE functionality.
We can write a function and its limits on the x and y axis and it plots it.
We resorted to the elements:
- PushButton
- Textbox
- Axes
 
You can choose to plot using:
- Surf
- Mesh
- Contour

Surface, mesh, and contour plots are convenient ways to represent data that is a
function of two independent variables.Mesh creates a mesh or wireframe plot,Surf creates a surface plot and the same for Contour.

All colors are default set.
